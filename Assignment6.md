## Video Removal Data

  
Recently, TikTok has gotten vocal pressure to monitor their video content due to the influx of younger viewers signing up for the app. As part of their initiative to release Transparency Reports to the public, TikTok has started releasing the amount of videos removed for policy violations, along with the specific reason as to why the video was removed. 

The data used in this [chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UlR3Lh4b6HM_-B76ZENpCGwOaV_cAkyMSOf2W4xnkAs/edit#gid=1507183171) was taken directly from [TikTok’s Community Guidelines Enforcement Report](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en/community-guidelines-enforcement-2022-3/). This report is described as being able to provide “quarterly insights into the volume and nature of content and accounts removed from our platform.” This particular chart shows how many videos, by millions, were removed and are labeled for each policy they violated. Noticeably, at the first recorded quarter ending in September 2020, there were only a few millions of each category reported, before doubling by December 2020. This influx could correlate to more users joining the app during the pandemic and creating more content, which would give TikTok more videos it might have to remove. 

Most notably, the ‘minor safety’ category has consistently been the largest category to have videos removed for policy violations. In just one year from September 2020 to September 2021, videos removed for minor safety had increased by over 8 million videos. Minor safety has been a common source of debate for internet and social media users, due to the chance of underage viewers being exposed or exploited. TikTok defines their ‘minor safety’ guideline as prohibiting "activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.” With such an emphasis on maintaining minor safety, it is both comforting and alarming that the highest cause of removal for TikTok videos is for minor safety.
