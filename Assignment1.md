## Class Ratings
- ### Averages, Means, and Minimums of Data 
I think this was a smart way of gathering data regarding the class's experience level. Aside from an outlier student that is experienced with almost every area listed in the survey, the Average being **0.8** for most data experience levels seems accurate from what was said before the survey was submitted. 
- ### Microsoft, Excel and Data Programs
One thing that I found most interesting about the gathered data is that just because a member of the class has experience with one program or system, it doesn't mean they will have experience with another. One student has a **4** with Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets, a **2** with Version Control System, and then a **3** with Scripting Language. Yet another student has a **3** with Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets, but a **0** with everything else. I think it's exciting to have a class full of people with different experiences and backgrounds in the same subject matter because it will allow everyone the chance to learn something new. 
- ### Journalism Interest Areas
Although a few students are interested in the same areas of journalism, with Politics and Investigative being the most popular, there is still a wide range of interests. I believe these differences in specific interests of journalism prove how important learning and sharing data is for every area of journalism.
