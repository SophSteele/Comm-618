My data proposal will be looking at if the normalization of discussing mental health disorders will lead to a rise of those seeking treatment for them.   

I plan to study data from GoogleTrends, which shows how often words or phrases have been searched and if they’re “trending”, to see if the rise in searching for mental disorders has led to a rise in searching for positive mental health and mental health treatment. I also plan to interview those involved in the mental health field, such as therapists and mental health advocates, along with reaching out to social media experts.   

With various social media apps and the almost complete anonymity provided by the internet, users on different platforms have been inclined to open up more about their life experiences. Funny pet videos, a totaled car wreck, or friends getting into shenanigans are just a few of the types of posts people can find on services such as TikTok, Youtube, Tumblr, Twitter and more. With the comfort of sharing and sometimes oversharing to strangers on the internet, many users have turned to their digital audiences to work through the ups and downs of their mental health journeys.  

TikTok especially has earned a notorious reputation for causing a multitude of users to “self-diagnose” different disorders such as bipolar personality disorder (BPD), anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and many more. Some have argued that the frequent, oversharing from individuals about the harder sides of living with certain disorders, such as self-harm or needing to be hospitalized, can create an unnecessary, negative internet space. Others have argued that sharing these stories with the intent to educate and encourage is beneficial, and can encourage users to seek help.
