New insight into the Trump campaign’s financial expenses and spending habits based on compiled receipts and data sorting.  

Countless receipts and documents regarding the Trump presidency campaign’s expenses are available on the Federal Election Commission website. The data was able to share information about the payment recipient, the payee, the state and city, and the disbursement amount. After gathering the data, most of the expenses fall under 8 main categories: administrative, contributions, fundraising, materials, refunds,transfer, travel and other.   

-Ideally, there would be a chance to interview a finance or campaign expert. In this space, I would include their insight into what categories the usual campaign expenses fall under, and perhaps a general estimate into how much money goes in each category/election campaign.-  

The data gathered looks at disbursement amounts from year 2016 through year 2022, excluding year 2019 which was unavailable. When gathering all the resources containing the word “Trump” from the Federal Election Commission website, data applying specifically to the presidential campaign was mixed with data about the Trump hotels, a Charles Trump, and the act to impeach Trump. After sorting the non-presidential election information from the disbursement information only regarding the presidential campaign, the disbursement amount was a grand total of 25,982,505.73, which was 1532791.95 less than the amount started with.  

-If possible, perhaps try to interview Charles Trump or those involved in the Impeach Trump PAC to see what they were using the disbursements for. Perhaps interview a Trump hotel spokesperson as well or, if someone else were to write about Trump hotel’s spending, link to that article somewhere in this paragraph with a brief summary.-  

When looking only at the presidential campaign spending, the contributions and refunds categories are no longer relevant as there was no disbursement exchange. The fundraising category contains the lowest disbursement amount, with only 22766.83 recorded for years 2016 through 2022. But the highest category is travel, with an amount of 34440982.66 that far surpasses the others by a solid couple of millions.

  With the next highest category being other, at only 7746342.62 of disbursement, it would be interesting to see just what the Trump presidential campaign was using these disbursements for. Is there a specific location that was traveled to the most frequently, and if so why?  
  
First, I created three pivot tables of all the data. The first pivot table was used to calculate the totals and was where I wrote the later data amounts I found. The second pivot table was used to find the specific totals of each category, but was not filtered by recipient. The third and final pivot table was filtered to only include recipients involving the presidential campaign, excluding the hotels and impeachment, before being used to calculate the totals of each category. Then I compared the data and noticed the significant amount in travel versus the other categories which made me believe creating a column chart would be the best example.
