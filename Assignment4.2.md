Dear Editor,  

Many congressional representatives have earned praise after posting pictures of their dogs on social media. At home with their humans or in office at Capitol Hill, the dogs of Congress have been a point of interest for many animal-loving people. The dogs themselves have gained attention after they have been used to lighten the political mood surrounding Capitol Hill, and a few [select pooches have even had articles written about their effective morale boosting abilities](https://rollcall.com/2022/10/27/who-can-lift-up-congress-maybe-dogs/). I am planning to gather data on which representatives have dogs and what breed of dog or dogs they have. I think it would be interesting to see which side of Congress has more dogs, if one political party has more dog owners, and if there is a more popular breed seen among representatives.  

To collect the data, I would first start by going through social media. A few representatives have posted their [pets on their Instagrams, and others have even made separate accounts for their dogs.](https://www.popsugar.com/pets/photo-gallery/48196724/embed/48196763/AOC) I would also reach out to the Twitter account ["Dogs on the hill"](https://twitter.com/capitolhilldogs) as they receive photos sent in by those working in or near Capitol Hill. After using social media, I would need assitance from people either working in Capitol Hill or from those with contacts there. I believe some of the best ways to get this data would be to try calling the representatives or members on their staff, as some of the information such as the breed of the dog would best be gathered in person.  

Other sources that I would use to gather my data from are different feature pieces, such as [Roll Call: Meet the Dogs of the Senate](https://rollcall.com/2017/05/01/meet-the-dogs-of-the-senate/) and [Roll Call: Who can lift up Congress? Maybe dogs](https://rollcall.com/2022/10/27/who-can-lift-up-congress-maybe-dogs/). However these two articles don't provide a complete list. Other pieces aren't current, and I would have to compile and organize all the current data. I would separate the members by name, position, party, if they have a dog and if so what breed. Attached below is a brief example of how I would organize my data:   


| Representative | House of Rep./Senate | Party | Dog | Breed |
----------------- | ------------------- | ------ | -----| ----| 
| Roy Blunt       | Senate              | Republican | 1 | Yorkipoo |
| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez | House of Rep.| Democrat | 1| French Bulldog| 
| Suzan DelBene   | House of Rep.     | Democrat   | 1 | Golden Retriever |
|Mary Peltola    | House of Rep.       | Democrat | 1  | Unknown- Mutt |
| Marco Rubio    | Senate              | Republican | 1 | Pembroke Welsh Corgi |
