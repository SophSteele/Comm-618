## The Internet's biggest influencer: mental health

In recent years, mental health has become a nationwide topic, and it seems like people are finally ready to address it. 

The recent rise in those seeking treatment matches studies following the changes in mental health of students in middle and high school. These studies show a yearly change that connects the rate of internet use with mental health disorders.  

Dr. Jessica Ruzicka is a guidance counselor for students at Southside Christian School. She’s noticed firsthand the connecting changes between her students’ mental wellbeing and their time on social media. 

“There’s an increase in anxiety and a fear of missing out,” Dr. Ruzicka said about her students. “Some say they are over stressed and anxious and feeling more social pressures or not feeling connected to others very much.” 

Dr. Ruzicka believes that part of this could be lingering aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the loneliness countless people developed while having to stay isolated. 

On April 23, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began a survey to study the mental health of people living through the COVID-19 pandemic. A collaboration between the CDC, the U.S. Census Bureau and five other federal agencies released The Household Pulse Survey to the public and found that the group with the highest rate of anxiety disorder or depressive disorder was the 18-29 age group with each subsequent age group showing less and less signs of anxiety and depression.

The survey asked those participating to answer questions that would indicate if they were suffering from anxiety or depression, based on the CDC’s own scale for measuring a mental health disorder. Originally created for the pandemic, the Household Pulse survey has been continued through subsequent years with the most recent numbers coming from more than 65,000 participants surveyed in February 2023. 

Even as the pandemic and the necessary precautions for stopping the spread of COVID-19 have passed, the mental health crisis continues to rise. It is especially evident in the youngest age group, as recorded in the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which is a study from the Indiana Department of Health with help from the CDC. 

This survey covers a wide range of topics, including mental health and mental health disorders, and looks at high schools and middle schools around the entire state of Indiana, giving them access to nearly 700 students per school. As shown in the chart below, the study found a rise in depression, feeling hopeless, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts that correlated with the CDC’s findings of the younger age groups experiencing mental health issues more.

The steady climb throughout the years is nearly mirrored by the amount of children and teenagers using social media and the internet daily. A study from Pew Research Center that surveyed 1,316 teenagers in the United States found that, as of 2022, 46% of teenagers say they use the internet constantly, which is almost double the amount from those surveyed in 2014, where only 24% of teenagers self-identified as using the internet constantly. 
Erin Judge, a pediatric nurse at Atrium Health Levine Children’s Hospital, has seen the direct impact this continual internet use has had on children’s mental health. 

“I think that comparison and dissatisfaction with finances and appearances are the biggest problem,” Judge said. “There’s been an uptick in eating disorders.” 

Judge believes that mostly “middle school and teenagers are most affected by trends and mental health impact of social media” and that the continual bombardment of these trends is negatively impacting their mental health. Within the Atrium Health Levine Children’s Hospital, Judge said that she has seen the direct impact of social media, but especially TikTok, on the mental health of kids. 

There’s discussion of mental health amongst the kids, but not in a way that involves research before treatment, Judge said. “Definitely a lot of open discussions about mental health to the point that it’s joked about.” 

The CDC reported in 2021 that “the percentage of adults who had received any mental health treatment in the past 12 months increased from 2019 to 2021, among both adults of all ages (from 19.2% to 21.6%) and those aged 18–44 (from 18.5% to 23.2%)” which is a significant increase. For children, the CDC released a report stating that “in 2019, 13.6% of children aged 5–17 years had received any mental health treatment in the past 12 months, including 8.4% who had taken medication for their mental health and 10.0% who received counseling or therapy from a mental health professional.” 

But since the pandemic, it seems things haven’t changed. According to Year in Search by Google and Google Trends, in May 2021 the word and phrase most searched by the world was “how to maintain mental health.” As more searches and CDC reports reveal the steady rise of a mental health crisis, internet platforms and social media apps continue to rise in their own way.  

Pew Research Center found that the most used apps were Youtube, followed closely by TikTok, then Instagram and Snapchat. The newest of these social media apps, TikTok, has grown rapidly throughout the years. On September 27, 2021, TikTok announced that they have over 1 billion users. According to an article on Insider Intelligence, TikTok is projected to have 834.3 million monthly users worldwide in 2023, according to Insider Intelligence’s forecast. 

With increased attention on the popular app, the company has started releasing Transparency Reports to the general public. The data used in this chart was taken directly from TikTok’s Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. This report is described as being able to provide “quarterly insights into the volume and nature of content and accounts removed from our platform.” This particular chart shows how many videos, by millions, were removed and are labeled for each policy they violated.

Noticeably, at the first recorded quarter ending in September 2020, there were only a few millions of each category reported, before doubling by December 2020. This influx could correlate to more users joining the app during the pandemic and creating more content, which would give TikTok more videos it might have to remove. 

Most notably, the ‘minor safety’ category has consistently been the largest category to have videos removed for policy violations. In just one year from September 2020 to September 2021, videos removed for minor safety had increased by over 8 million videos. Minor safety has been a common source of debate for internet and social media users, due to the chance of underage viewers being exposed or exploited. TikTok defines their ‘minor safety’ guideline as prohibiting "activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.” With such an emphasis on maintaining minor safety, it is both comforting and alarming that the highest cause of removal for TikTok videos is for minor safety. 

But even with TikTok's precautions, videos still slip through the cracks. Chuldren are exposed to content that gives them body image issues, social anxiety and various mental health disorders they don't need to be exposed to at a young age. And with teenagers reporting their own internet use as constant, the chances for them to be exposed to damaging content rises. 

But for all the negative content, there is also good. There is content that supports seeking help, and as the CDC's numbers have shown, at the very least adults are slowly but surely figuring that out and receiving treatment.  

While it seems like everyone is ready to talk about mental health, both in-person and online, there won’t be real change until more people, especially the younger generation, are able to start receiving the actual help and treatment they need. Something that can only be provided by a licensed professional, and not an internet guru.
